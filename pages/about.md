#### From the desk of Saswat Das

Hey there!

I'm delighted to have you around. I am Saswat, though if you run the risk of calling me Sasquatch (ahem...), then feel free to call me Aiden.

Professionally speaking, I am an Integrated Master of Science (Int.Â [M.Sc](http://m.sc/).) student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (abbrev. NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, and a student researcher in Dr. Subhankar Mishra's Lab (a.k.a. SM Lab) at NISER. My research interests broadly lie in differential privacy, privacy in machine learning (including DPML and federated learning), cryptography, and network security.

Ethnically I am Odia and am currently based in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, but I spent a major chunk of my childhood in Navi Mumbai in a wonderful suburb named Seawoods Darave.

On here, I'll be posting about my work, things that catch my fancy and discussions on recent developments in fields that interest me. In addition you can find me lost in music-induced trances, producing questionably trippy music on DAWs, kicking a football around, or writing random pieces of prose and poetry (the majority of which I might take to my grave).

I also enjoy organising events and running logistics (which is as fun as it sounds), hosting events and public speaking, and giving talks and tutoring; and I have had quite some experience with leadership. I have had the honour of serving as the Head Boy of Delhi Public School Kalinga, Odisha (2016-18), and the President of Quizone, NISER's Quiz Club (2019-2021). I have also volunteered as a tutor and mentor with Avanti Fellows, Aveti Learning, and as a Section Leader in CodeInPlace, Stanford University, and at my college.

Feel free to get in touch with me if you wish to collaborate or simply talk about my work. I am also open to giving talks about my work and research.



Ciao!
